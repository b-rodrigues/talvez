# talvez

`talvez` (*maybe* in both Portuguese and Spanish) is a Python implementing the
*maybe* monad, inspired by the R package
[`maybe`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maybe/index.html). It provides
a set of functional primitives for safe, composable handling of optional values
and computations that may fail. With `talvez`, you can eliminate scattered
`try`/`except` blocks, make failures explicit, and easily chain computations in
a declarative, readable way. This making your code safer and more robust in the
face of unexpected or missing values.

## Quick start

TBC

This package is in early alpha and requires more work. But do take a look at the
tutorial!
